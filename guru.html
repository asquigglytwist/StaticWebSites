        	<h2>About the Guru</h2>
            <div>
            	Bharata Natyam, the supreme art form which skillfully embodies the three primary ingredients of dance - BHavam, RAgam and THalam, fascinated Mrs. Kousalya Nivas right from toddlerhood. She started to learn dance at the age of 4. She has done nearly 300 stage performances. She has been performing professionally for the past 25 years and is one of the most sought after dancers of her generation. She has bagged more awards in state level and national level competition in Bharata Natyam. She brings to her dance a rare sense of devotion and dedication, which leaves the audience with a sense of spiritual fulfillment. 
            </div>
            <div>
            	Mrs. Kousalya Nivas is a well-trained dancer on Bharata Natyam and also on other forms of dances. She is a disciple of following Gurus:

                Endowed with a pleasing stage presence, Kousalya Nivas brings to her audience a refreshing presentation of Bharata Natyam, exhibited through her strong sense of rhythm, scintillating nritta and lively abhinaya. Everyone who has seen Kousalya Nivas perform is struck by her unique thought process and fresh approach to dance. While deeply rooted in tradition she has evolved her own individual style without affecting the core principles of Bharata Natyam.
            </div>
            <div>

            </div>
            <div>
            	Mrs. Kousalya Nivas hopes that as she strives towards greater excellence in dancing, her passion for Bharata Natyam and other forms of art will endow her with courage to break boundaries and widen her horizons in all avenues of life. Her vision is to pass on the varied culture and glorious heritage of this wonderful art to the young and upcoming generation.  To accomplish this, she started her own dance school M.S.NATYALAYA in Marathahalli, Bangalore during 2012. She is training nearly more than 80 students. She has dedicated herself in spreading this beautiful art to the people. She acknowledges her sincere thanks to her Gurus for their expert guidance and her parents &amp; in-laws who have identified and greatly encouraged her in making her dreams a reality. She greatly appreciates her husband and son without whose cooperation and support, pursuing her passion &amp; running this institute would have been impossible.
